 push operation on stack ,
 adds an item on top of stack , if full then it is said to be stack overflow . 

 algo :
 1. before pushing the element to the stack , we check if the stack is full
 2. if the stack is full (top == capacity-1) , then stack overflows and we cannot insert the element to the stack
 3. otherwise we incremenet the value of top by 1 (top ++) and the new value is inserted at top position 
 4. we can do this until we reach overflow condition
