# physical data structures :
## 1. Array
- A collection of contiguous memory locations .
- Is static , once its created then its size cannot be changed .
- Can be created inside the stack or the heap using a pointer .

## 2. Linked list
- It is a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a link to the next node .
- The length of this list can grow and reduce dynamically , hence it has variable length .
- Linked list is always created in the heap .

# Logical data structures :
- Logical data strucutes are implemented using physical data structures 
## 1. Stack 
- linear data structure .
- works on LIFO (last in first out) principle .
## 2. Queue 
- Linear data strcture .
- works on FIFO principle .
## 3. Trees 
- non linear data structure .
## 4. Graph
- non linear data structure .
## 5. Hash table 
- Tabular data structure .
