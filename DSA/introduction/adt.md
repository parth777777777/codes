# Abstract data type (adt):
An ADT is a conceptual model that defines a set of operations and behaviours for a DS wihtout specifying how these operations are implemented or how data is organized in memory , 

The definiton of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented . 

Its called abstract because it provided an implementation - independent view . 
The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
