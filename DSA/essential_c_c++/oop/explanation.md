Topic: bridging the gap between functional programming and oop

in structures_and_functions.cpp , it is demonstrated how a program can be written using structures and functions. The main function has no commands of its own , it only calls functions . And all function calls are related to the structure rectangle . 
This program can be written with oop, by creating a class rectangle and the functions can be transformed into class methods .
